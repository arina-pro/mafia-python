# mafia-python
A .py project emulating the game of Mafia with mafia, peaceful citizens and the commissar (acted out as the user).
A .py project emulating the game of Mafia with mafia, peaceful citizens and the commissar.
The user acts as the latter, trying to catch all mafia members and thus 'purge' the corrupted city by checking the identities of citizens
and voting during the daily assembly.
As in the original game, there is daytime when the voting is held
and nighttime when the checking (by commissar) and the killing of peaceful citizens (by mafia) are conducted.
The roles are randomly assigned among 10 citizens and the voting is random to certain limitations.
The Python classes are Citizen and City. Possibly a Mafia class could be created separately.
This program was written for the college course on Python as an object-oriented programming assignment.
